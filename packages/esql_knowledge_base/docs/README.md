# ES|QL Knowledge Base

Use the ES|QL Knowledge Base integration to enable ES|QL query generation within the Elastic AI Assistant.

For example, once installed, you can ask the Elastic AI Assistant questions like:

* "Generate an ES|QL query for the top 10 countries with the most sales"
* "Generate an ES|QL query for my most recent open security detection alerts of high risk"

## Data streams

Adds a combination of ES|QL documentation, sample prompts, and language files to the `kb-esql-default` data stream.

## Requirements

If generating new embeddings, the latest version of ELSER must be installed and configured.

## Setup

Install integration to create Knowledge Base docs and enable ES|QL query generation within the Elastic AI Assistant.
